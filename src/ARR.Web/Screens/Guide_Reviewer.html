                        The assign session reviewer dialog is where you choose a specific reviewer for the

                            domain requirements than developers or architects reviewing the technical sufficiency in a

                            Expertise- skills or areas of concentration that the reviewer has noted in his/her profile- what the reviewer has noted he/she likes to do- types include (see below)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Experience- inventory of reviews the reviewer has completed in the past- what the reviewer has proven he/she is good at

                        <li>
                            Responsibility- level at which the reviewer can provide well thought out answers to review questions- in the active review process answers are positive assertions necessitating thought not discovering more obvious errors through cursory reading
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           Motivation- Understanding that the reward for full participation in the review session is to gain a better understanding of the project and to improve the viability of the down stream products like the software that will be created- a professional reviewer will accept the chance to learn about and improve the work of their peers
                        </li>

                            Reviews determining if business goals and customer needs are appropriate require domain expertise, reviews to determine that requirements are unambiguous enough to develop the right software product require technical expertise, reviews that evaluate certain qualities inherent in the specifications like organization require process or methodology expertise
                        </li>
                        <li>
