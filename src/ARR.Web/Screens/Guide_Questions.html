                            <small>Questions should have a single “concern” per question- avoid mixed purposes or

                        <p>
                            <small>Questions should provide the necessary context- for example when a question 
                            measures conformance to a standard, rule, or domain specific convention, it 
                            should includes details by which to measure requirement</small>

                        <p>
                            <small>Questions can ask for concrete use of requirement- for example you can ask the 
                            reviewer to explain what an application would do with specified inputs</small>

                        <p>
                            <small>Questions should lead to descriptive answers rather than simple affirm/deny 
                            (“yes/no”) answers- start questions with “Which…” or “What…” rather than 
                            “Does…” or “Is…” to yield more open questions</small>

                            the session questionnaire- ask the reviewer to evaluate the session using 
                            questions about the questions themselves or about the review session-
