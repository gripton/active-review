                            want to accomplish, what type of errors we want to uncover or what qualities 
                            of the requirements we want to validate

                            Determine the general types of questions and questioning techniques that are 
                            useful for accomplishing the objectives of the session

                            Organize the requirements into reviewable sections- details pertaining to different 
                            classes of questions isolated in their own sections to the extent possible
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a few questions (at most 5-10) that cover one central detail of the 
                            session from highest to lowest level of the scope or most general to most 
                            specific- this leads to a small “vertical slice” of review questions

                        <li>

                            of the scope of the session- this leads to a “horizontal slice” (breadthwise) 
                            of the review questions
                        </li>

                            coverage of the requirements specified is complete- each question should 
                            pertain to or “cover” a goal of the session for a specific area of the 
                            specification

                            Before releasing the session make a final check to confirm that questions cover 
                            the entire scope of the review (both in level of detail and breadth of sections

                            Questions should have a single “concern” per question- avoid mixed purposes or 
                            objectives in a single question
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Questions should provide the necessary context- for example when a question 
                            measures conformance to a standard, rule, or domain specific convention, it 
                            should includes details by which to measure requirement

                        <li>
                            Questions can ask for concrete use of requirement- for example you can ask the 
                            reviewer to explain what an application would do with specified inputs 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Questions should lead to descriptive answers rather than simple affirm/deny 
                            (“yes/no”) answers- start questions with “Which…” or “What…” rather than 
                            “Does…” or “Is…” to yield more open questions
                        </li>

                            (Meta-questions can determine the effectiveness or quality of the session and 
                            the session questionnaire- ask the reviewer to evaluate the session using 
                            questions about the questions themselves or about the review session- 
                            this discussion can also take place in the forum part of the ARR tool)
